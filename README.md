# Medical Records Processing System

A Python-based system for organizing and analyzing medical records using AI. This system extracts information from medical documents, processes them using OpenAI's GPT models, and generates structured analysis. The system is designed to make it easy to find and review medical records, as well as to provide insights into the data contained within the records.

The system is organized into several components:

* Text extraction: This component extracts text from medical documents, including PDFs, images, and other formats.
* AI analysis: This component uses OpenAI's GPT models to analyze the text extracted from medical documents and generate structured analysis.
* Structured data output: This component takes the structured analysis generated by the AI analysis component and formats it for output in various formats, such as CSV, JSON, and Excel.
* Web-based viewer: This component provides a web-based interface for viewing and searching medical records.
* Configuration: This component provides a configuration system for customizing the processing pipeline and specifying the output format.

## Features

- Automated processing of medical records in various formats (PDF, TXT)
- Text extraction and OCR capabilities
- AI-powered analysis using OpenAI's GPT models
- Structured data output in multiple formats
- Web-based viewer for processed records
- Configurable processing pipeline

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical_records_2024.git
cd medical_records_2024
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up configuration:
   - Copy `config/config.template.yaml` to `config/config.yaml`
   - Update the configuration with your settings
   - Create a `.api_keys.env` file with your API keys

## Configuration

The system uses a YAML configuration file (`config/config.yaml`) for settings. A template is provided in `config/config.template.yaml`. Key configurations include:

- Input/output directories
- AI model settings
- Processing parameters
- File handling options

## Usage

1. Place medical records in the configured input directory
2. Run the processing script:
```bash
python main.py
```

3. Access processed records through the web viewer in the output directory
